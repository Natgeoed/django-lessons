#. Main Well tabs

   #. Directions

         Lists the associated activities in order; transitional blocks may appear between activities, and an Informal Assessment may appear at the end. At the top of the tab is a list of activities in the lesson - educators can click on the name of a lesson, to toggle its display in this lesson.

   #. Objectives
   #. Preparation

          Resources Provided - this information must be driven by the resource carousel (as it currently is for Activities)

   #. Background & Vocabulary
   #. Comments

   Because each of these tabs (excluding comments) will display a deduped rollup of its own data combined with that of its associated activities, and because each of these activities can be disabled or enabled, performance may be an issue. To handle this issue, each of these rollups should be fetched by an ajax call.
   The 'Preparation' tab will be simple, as it is just made up of rows from the Material table. The other tabs will be less straightforward, as they come from TextArea fields.

#. Related Materials module - 'See the Activity in Practice' tab
