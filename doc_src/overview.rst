Overview
========

Activities are one of the base content types in NG Education.

A lesson is a sequential grouping of activities, targeted to Teachers and Informal Educators. Their purpose is to organize activities thematically, and give them an order

* It is important to note that each activity may belong to multiple lessons. While an educator is viewing a lesson, they will be able to enable or disable individual activities.
* Lessons have directions, objectives, preparation, and background & vocabulary - much of this information will come from the activities that make up each lesson. In addition, comments can be left on each lesson and transitions can be inserted between activities.

Future additions - units, curricula

Goals
=====

#. Lessons will have associated data for Objectives and Background. There should be a way to import this data from the Activities that make up the Lesson. It should be safe to assume that this import will only be used once (when the Lesson is first created).

#. Lessons can appear in both search results and collections, so their fields will need to be indexed.
