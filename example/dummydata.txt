Discuss community <a class=\"tipHelp\">push factor</a>s and <a class=\"tipHelp\">pull factor</a>s.</strong><br />Have a whole-class discussion about community push and pull factors. Ask:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\r\n<li><em>Why do different communities have different push and pull factors?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>How do these factors make a place unique?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>What can we learn about ourselves from this kind of information? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>Why is it important to preserve and pass on this information for future people? <br /></em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Have students interview a person in the community who migrated.</strong><br />If possible, have students conduct an interview with a person in the community who migrated in one form or another. Help students choose people to interview, such as family members, teachers, or other students. The person may have <a class=\"tipHelp\">emigrate</a>d from another country, moved from another state, or moved from a rural area to an urban area or vice versa. As a class, develop a list of interview questions, such as:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\r\n<li><em>Where and when were you born? What do you remember about that place?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>When did you come to this community? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>What is the primary reason you came to this community? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>What were your first impressions about the community? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>How have you seen the community change since then? What do you think caused those changes? </em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Have students compare and contrast the push and pull factors of the people they interviewed.</strong><br />Draw a simple T-chart on the board. Have each student share the push or pull factors that motivated their interviewee to move to the community. List them in the T-Chart. Then ask:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\r\n<li><em>What are some similarities among the people interviewed?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>What are some differences? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>What trends do you notice? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>What are some common reasons people have moved to the community?</em></li>\r\n</ul>",
