Then have the student pass the clipboards in two different directions. Each clipboard will now be on a different journey and will accumulate its own mutations. When the scientists return, ask them to reconstruct the two migration routes, and the point where they converge to a common ancestor. Explain that the two clipboards represent two living populations separated in the past that moved in different directions. Reinforce that the desk papers represent those populations' ancestors, and not people living in those areas now.
